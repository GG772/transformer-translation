## Introduction

**Transformer Translation** is a deep learning project implementing a Transformer-based model for text translation, particularly suited for ancient Chinese. It provides scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, and is designed for researchers, students, and developers interested in NLP and machine translation.

**Main Features:**
- Customizable Transformer architecture (layers, heads, etc.)
- Data preprocessing utilities for parallel corpora
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Tokenization using pretrained BERT for ancient Chinese
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- `transformers` library (for tokenizer)
- See `requirements.txt` for full dependencies

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-translation.git
cd transformer-translation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Place your parallel data (JSON format) in the `data/` directory.
2. Use the helper script to preprocess data:
   ```bash
   python utils/helpers.py
   ```
   This will generate `train_src.txt`, `train_tgt.txt`, `val_src.txt`, and `val_tgt.txt` in `data/`.

### Training

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```
- Model checkpoints are saved in `checkpoints/`.

### Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```
- Prints sample translations and model predictions.

## Configuration

Edit `scripts/train_config.py` to adjust:
- Number of epochs
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Model dimensions (d_model, n_head, etc.)

---

## API Reference

- `model/model.py`: Transformer, Encoder, Decoder, and attention modules
- `utils/dataloader.py`: CustomDataset for loading and batching data
- `utils/tokenizer.py`: Loads and configures the BERT tokenizer for ancient Chinese

---

## Examples

- See `scripts/train.py` and `scripts/evaluate.py` for end-to-end training and evaluation workflows.
